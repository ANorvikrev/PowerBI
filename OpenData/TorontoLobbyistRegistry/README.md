Toronto Lobbyist Registry Power BI visualization with active lobbying cases and the first report shows overall analysis of lobbying cases, with top 10 Subject Matters and Top 10 Beneficiaries. It also allows parses decisions (issues) to be lobbied in a form of a word cloud. All visualizations are interactive: try clicking different pie chart sections or words. To filter years on the bar chart you will need to hold Ctrl and select a year, otherwise, by selecting a bar you will drill down its data.
The arrow button at the bottom of the report will take you to the 2nd page, which will show communication diagrams between lobbyists and public office holders. To activate those diagrams you need to select a particular lobbying case and “lobbyist to public offices” and “lobbyist to public office holder names” visualization will appear.
